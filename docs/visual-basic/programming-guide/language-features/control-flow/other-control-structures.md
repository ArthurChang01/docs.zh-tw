# <a name="other-control-structures-visual-basic"></a>其他控制結構 (Visual Basic)
Visual Basic provides control structures that help you dispose of a resource or reduce the number of times you have to repeat an object reference.  
  
## <a name="usingend-using-construction"></a>Using...End Using Construction  
 The `Using...End Using` construction establishes a statement block within which you make use of a resource such as a SQL connection. You can optionally acquire the resource with the `Using` statement. When you exit the `Using` block, Visual Basic automatically disposes of the resource so that it is available for other code to use. The resource must be local and disposable. 如需詳細資訊，請參閱 [Using 陳述式](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md)。  
  
## <a name="withend-with-construction"></a>With...End With Construction  
 The `With...End With` construction lets you specify an object reference once and then run a series of statements that access its members. This can simplify your code and improve performance because Visual Basic does not have to re-establish the reference for each statement that accesses it. For more information, see [With...End With Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md).
