# <a name="walkthrough-validating-that-passwords-are-complex-visual-basic"></a>逐步解說：驗證密碼確實複雜 (Visual Basic)
This method checks for some strong-password characteristics and updates a string parameter with information about which checks the password fails.  
  
 Passwords can be used in a secure system to authorize a user. However, the passwords must be difficult for unauthorized users to guess. Attackers can use a *dictionary attack* program, which iterates through all of the words in a dictionary (or multiple dictionaries in different languages) and tests whether any of the words work as a user's password. Weak passwords such as "Yankees" or "Mustang" can be guessed quickly. Stronger passwords, such as "?You'L1N3vaFiNdMeyeP@sSWerd!", are much less likely to be guessed. A password-protected system should ensure that users choose strong passwords.  
  
 A strong password is complex (containing a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters) and is not a word. This example demonstrates how to verify complexity.  
  
## <a name="example"></a>範例  
  
### <a name="code"></a>程式碼  
 [!code-vb[VbVbcnRegEx#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnRegEx/VB/Class1.vb#1)]  
  
## <a name="compiling-the-code"></a>編譯程式碼  
 Call this method by passing the string that contains that password.  
  
 這個範例需要：  
  
- <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions> 命名空間成員的存取權。 新增 `Imports` 陳述式 (如果未在程式碼中完整限定成員名稱)。 如需詳細資訊，請參閱 [Imports 陳述式 (.NET 命名空間和類型)](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md)。  
  
## <a name="security"></a>安全性  
 If you're moving the password across a network, you need to use a secure method for transferring data. For more information, see [ASP.NET Web Application Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/aspnet/330a99hc(v=vs.100)).
  
 You can improve the accuracy of the `ValidatePassword` function by adding additional complexity checks:  
  
- Compare the password and its substrings against the user's name, user identifier, and an application-defined dictionary. In addition, treat visually similar characters as equivalent when performing the comparisons. For example, treat the letters "l" and "e" as equivalent to the numerals "1" and "3".  
  
- If there is only one uppercase character, make sure it is not the password's first character.  
  
- Make sure that the last two characters of the password are letter characters.  
  
- Do not allow passwords in which all the symbols are entered from the keyboard's top row.
