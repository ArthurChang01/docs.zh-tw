## <a name="the-managed-heap"></a><span data-ttu-id="c9811-146">Managed 堆積</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-146">The managed heap</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-147">CLR 初始化記憶體回收行程之後，記憶體回收行程就會配置用來儲存和管理物件的記憶體區段。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-147">After the garbage collector is initialized by the CLR, it allocates a segment of memory to store and manage objects.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-148">這個記憶體稱為 Managed 堆積，與作業系統中的原生堆積相反。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-148">This memory is called the managed heap, as opposed to a native heap in the operating system.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-149">每個 Managed 處理序都有一個 Managed 堆積。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-149">There is a managed heap for each managed process.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-150">處理序中的所有執行緒都會對相同堆積上的物件配置記憶體。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-150">All threads in the process allocate memory for objects on the same heap.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-151">To reserve memory, the garbage collector calls the Windows [VirtualAlloc](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) function and reserves one segment of memory at a time for managed applications.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-151">To reserve memory, the garbage collector calls the Windows [VirtualAlloc](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc) function and reserves one segment of memory at a time for managed applications.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-152">The garbage collector also reserves segments, as needed, and releases segments back to the operating system (after clearing them of any objects) by calling the Windows [VirtualFree](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree) function.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-152">The garbage collector also reserves segments, as needed, and releases segments back to the operating system (after clearing them of any objects) by calling the Windows [VirtualFree](/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualfree) function.</span></span>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-153">記憶體回收行程所配置的區段大小是依實作而定，有可能在任何時間，包括在定期更新時做變更。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-153">The size of segments allocated by the garbage collector is implementation-specific and is subject to change at any time, including in periodic updates.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-154">您的應用程式永遠都不應該對相關或根據特定區段的大小做出假設，也不應嘗試設定區段配置的可用記憶體數量。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-154">Your app should never make assumptions about or depend on a particular segment size, nor should it attempt to configure the amount of memory available for segment allocations.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-155">配置在堆積上的物件越少，記憶體回收行程必須進行的工作就越少。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-155">The fewer objects allocated on the heap, the less work the garbage collector has to do.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-156">當您配置物件時，請勿使用超出需求的進位值，例如，當您只需要 15 個位元組時，卻配置 32 個位元組的陣列。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-156">When you allocate objects, do not use rounded-up values that exceed your needs, such as allocating an array of 32 bytes when you need only 15 bytes.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-157">觸發記憶體回收時，記憶體回收行程就會回收無作用物件所佔據的記憶體。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-157">When a garbage collection is triggered, the garbage collector reclaims the memory that is occupied by dead objects.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-158">回收處理序會壓縮使用中物件，讓它們集合在一起，並且移除無作用物件，因而讓堆積更小。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-158">The reclaiming process compacts live objects so that they are moved together, and the dead space is removed, thereby making the heap smaller.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-159">這樣可確保一起配置的物件會在 Managed 堆積上集中，以便保持其區域性。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-159">This ensures that objects that are allocated together stay together on the managed heap, to preserve their locality.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-160">記憶體回收的干擾程度 (頻率和持續期間) 是 Managed 堆積上之配置量和未被回收記憶體數量的結果。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-160">The intrusiveness (frequency and duration) of garbage collections is the result of the volume of allocations and the amount of survived memory on the managed heap.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-161">您可以將此堆積視為兩個堆積的累積：[大型物件堆積](large-object-heap.md)和小型物件堆積。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-161">The heap can be considered as the accumulation of two heaps: the [large object heap](large-object-heap.md) and the small object heap.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="c9811-162">[大型物件堆積](large-object-heap.md)包含 85,000 個位元組以上的超大型物件。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-162">The [large object heap](large-object-heap.md) contains very large objects that are 85,000 bytes and larger.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-163">大型物件堆積上的物件通常是陣列。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-163">The objects on the large object heap are usually arrays.</span></span> <span data-ttu-id="c9811-164">超大型的執行個體物件非常罕見。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="c9811-164">It is rare for an instance object to be extremely large.</span></span>
